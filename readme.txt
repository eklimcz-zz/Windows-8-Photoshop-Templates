These are a set of Windows 8 Photoshop Design Templates. Every time I design a windows 8 app I go through the same process - take screenshots of my Window 8 tablet; creating guides and font sizes; start adding in content. In efforts to speed up our design process we made some template time-savers.

These templates should help you: 

- Set up proper margins and spacing 
- Find consistent Font Sizes & Weights
- Create a basic application flow
